## TODOs: 
Features intended for the next version:
- Add event emitters (file watcher, timer, CLI)
- Add management for long-lived processes like compilers or servers.
- Add suport for tasks - functions called on different events like CLI input, file changes etc...
- Add built-in task handlers like "exec", "clone", "restart".
